    "\n",
    "*Code Examples*\n",
    "https://anthropic.skilljar.com/model-context-protocol-advanced-topics/295172\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sampling\n",
    "- Sampling - allows a Server to access an LLM through connected MCP Client\n",
    "- This shifts responsibility and cost/complexity of text gen from server to client (simpler option, no need to enable MCP Server to access Claude)\n",
    "- In Tool function - include Context argument\n",
    "- Need server MCP code tool to include Sampling call\n",
    "- Need Client MCP code to include Callback function (& pass Sampling callback into Session object)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Process:\n",
    "1. LLM - MCP Client (within a Next JS server) Tool Call Request to MCP Server;\n",
    "2. MCP Server tool runs (w external service)\n",
    "3. Once complete - MCP Client summarises/consolidates results OR **SAMPLING**: MCP Server offloads LLM Call to MCP Client for summarisation/consolidation then report back\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logging & Notifications\n",
    "- Frequent logging, progress meters - inside Tool, Call\n",
    "- Need server MCP code Tool to include Context argument and use context built-in methods 'info', 'warning', 'debug', 'error', 'report_progress' (progress bar)\n",
    "- Need Client MCP code to include Callback function (& pass Logging callback into Session object)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Roots\n",
    "- Access users and Claude to access to specific files/folders; permissioning system; no need to hardcode full paths, can just use file names (no need to search entire filesystems)\n",
    "- Contains 2 Tools - read_dir (read list of files/folders in specific dir) & list_roots (list of roots - files/folderst the user has granted permissions to be read by server)\n",
    "- You can provide Roots to Claude through tool or just inject them into prompt\n",
    "- MCP Server - needs Files/Folders that other tools try to access are contained within a root (using Context and roots/filesystem built-in methods), and List_roots Tool (which accesses roots from Context), and is_path_allowed() check (which is then used throughouht when trying to use other tools)\n",
    "- Main.py - contain root paths/directories from CLI arguments (optional)\n",
    "- MCP Client - create roots and roots callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transports and Communication (MCP)\n",
    "- Messages Format (MCP server/client), STDIO transport, StreamableHTTP transport (& limitations)\n",
    "- Many methods - Transport (Client/server exchange of JSON messages) - HTTP, STIO, Websockets...etc\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Messages ###\n",
    "- Messages (client/server) - JSON format - MCP Spec (JSON or Typescript) -> https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/tree/main/schema\n",
    "- Different types - Some Client and some Server requests; List vs Notification\n",
    "- Result Messages [need response] - Call Tool Request/Result, List Prompts Request/Result, Read Resource Request/Result, Initialise Request/Result, Create Message Result/Request, List Roots Result/Request\n",
    "- Notification Messages [no response] - Progress Notification, Logging Message Notification, Tool List Changed Notification, Resource Updated Notification\n",
    "- Some messages sent from Client to Server; some from Server to Client (ServerRequest, ServerNotification...etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "### STDIO ###\n",
    "- Easiest, simplest, both client/server same machine\n",
    "1. Client launches MCP Server as subprocess\n",
    "2. Client sends messages to MCP Server using server 'stdin' (whenever running a program in terminal - if we write - we're writing to stdin)\n",
    "3. Server responds by writing to 'stdout'\n",
    "- Critical - either Server or Client can send a message at any time\n",
    "- Only appropriate - Client & Server in same machine\n",
    "- Process: Initialize Request, Initialize Result, Initialize Notification; Logging, Tool Calls...etc\n",
    "- 4 possible message types:\n",
    "1. Initial request Client - Server (write to stdin)\n",
    "2. Response Server - Client (write to stdout)\n",
    "3. Initial request Server - Client (write to stdout)\n",
    "4. Response Client - Server (write to stdin)\n",
    "- Great advantage STDIO - Both Client AND Server can initiate request/send messages (Must be in Same Machine) -> This isn't the case for StreamableHTTP Transport (Can be in Separate Machines).\n",
    "\n",
    "### StreamableHTTP Transport ###\n",
    "- Client/server can be in different machines - Remote connection/hosting\n",
    "- HTTP connection based\n",
    "- More complex vs STDIO, harder to implement all 4 communication patterns - challenging to set up: Server initiate/send communication; specific MCP settings - big impact - stateless_http (True/False), json_response (True/False)\n",
    "- HTTP (in general) - clients can easily Initiate Request to server (known URL) and Server can easily Respond to Client. But If Server wants to initiate request - it doesn't know HTTP Client address - challenging for Server to Initialise request.\n",
    "- In MCP - HTTP 'traditional' - struggle to implement MCP Server 'Initiated' messages (Requests/Notifications): Create Message Request, List Roots Requests, Progress Notification, Logging Notification.\n",
    "- Solution: StreamableHTTP - allows Server to make request to Client. However: using stateless_http and json_response to True will break the workaround.\n",
    "- StreamableHTTP process:\n",
    "1. MCP Client initialised connection (initialise request, initialise result, initalised notification) - includes Header - `mcp-session-id`\n",
    "2. Client GET MCP server with Session ID -> opens SSE Server Sent Events connection - long-lived connection (for any future Server to Client requests e.g. Sampling [calls to LLM], Progress Notifications)\n",
    "3. SSE Response allows Server to send requests to the client (i.e. Server initialised)\n",
    "4. Client Requests - include Session ID as header; Server opens new SSE Response\n",
    "5. First SSE Response - Server requests to client - long-lived (for any Server requests); Second/new SSE responses - closed after response provided (e.g. Tool call request)\n",
    "6. New Messages: Progress Notification - using first SSE Response (long-lived), Logging Message/Tool Call Result - Second temp SSE Response (closed after Tool Call result).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State and StreamableHTTP Transport**\n",
    "- If `stateless_http = True` or `json_response = True` - breaks StreamableHTTP Server to Client SSE (server-sent events) response abilities\n",
    "- `stateless_http = True` - For very popular MCP Servers - horizontal scaling - Load balancer before MCP Server;\n",
    "- If we need to build a scalable MCP Server - stateless_http = True; Clients don't get Session ID\n",
    "- Disables: Server to Client requests, Sampling, Progress reports notifications, Subscriptions (resource updates), POST request responses aren't streamed (`json_response = True`)\n",
    "- No Session ID = Can't use GET SSE Response pathway (can't use responses, sampling, progress logging, subscriptions)\n",
    "- In Stateless Mode - Client initialisation (initial request+response/initialized notification) - not needed\n",
    "- POST request responses aren't streamed if `json_response = True` - Request responses from Server to Client (no logging/streaming, just final results). You want simpler HTTP responses without streaming, just getting the final result as plain JSON.\n",
