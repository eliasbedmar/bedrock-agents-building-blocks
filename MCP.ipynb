    "## Summary - MCP Server Primitives\n",
    "- Tools - Model controlled - LLM decides when to call them; results used by LLM; Used - additional functionality to LLM\n",
    "- Resources - App-controlled - our App decides when to call these; used by our app; Used - getting data into app, adding context to messages\n",
    "- User-controlled - the User decides when to use them; Used - workflows to run based on user input (e.g. slash command/button click/menu option)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "- MCP - communication protocol - Sharing Tools, Resources, Prompts...etc that are very specialised (and not efficient to perform via 'local' tools by each local/Server) -> MCP Servers (remote) - exposed to external services. No need to author functions, schemas, prompts...etc. Also - no need to create functions that call external services/APIs.\n",
    "- Multiple MCP Servers available to client\n",
    "- MCP Servers - can be made by anyone - Service Providers - create official MCP Server implementations (tools schemas/functions).\n",
    "- MCP Server - Tools, Prompts, Resources (& Links to outside services)\n",
    "- Resources - determine behaviour/configuration of MCP server/tools (routing, interacting with DB...etc). Define server-side properties and behaviors in your MCP application. They are located in a resources directory in your project\n",
    "\n",
    "## MCP Client\n",
    "- MCP Client - Communication between our Server and MCP Server.\n",
    "- MCP - transport agnostic - they can communicate over many protocols\n",
    "- Locally/same machine - Standard IO (MCP Server implemented locally)\n",
    "- Remote - HTTP, Websockets...etc\n",
    "- Client needs to access - Tools, Resources, Prompts in MCP Server\n",
    "- MCP communication (spec) specifies different types of messages that can be exchanged\n",
    " - Main message types: ListToolsRequest, ListToolsResult, CallToolRequest, CallToolResult, ReadResourceRequest, ReadResourceResults\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example - Full Message Flow: User - Our 'app' Server - MCP Client - MCP Server - Claude - Ext Service (Github)\n",
    "1. User - ask our Server - 'what repos do i have'\n",
    "2. Our 'app' Server - ask MCP Client - List of Tools to send to Claude alongside user prompt\n",
    "3. MCP Client - send ListToolsRequest to MCP Server\n",
    "4. MCP Server - respond ListToolsResult to MCP Client\n",
    "5. Our 'app' Server - send user Query + Tools list to Claude\n",
    "6. Claude decides user tool - send ToolUse request to Server\n",
    "7. Server sends request to MCP Client with specific arguments\n",
    "8. MCP Client sends CallToolRequest to MCP Server\n",
    "9. MCP Server sends Request to External Service (e.g. Github)\n",
    "10. Ext Service (Github) response to MCP Server\n",
    "11. MCP Server sends CallToolResult to MCP Client\n",
    "12. MCP Client sends result of running tool to our 'app' Server\n",
    "13. Our Server has toolResult (full list of repos) and sends to Claude\n",
    "14. Claude provides full answer using toolResult to our 'app' Server\n",
    "15. 'App' Server provides final result back to user"

Resources expose data from files, APIs, databases, or any other source that an AI needs to understand context. Applications can access this information directly and decide how to use it - whether thatâ€™s selecting relevant portions, searching with embeddings, or passing it all to the model.\n",
    "- They allow MCP server to expose data to the client; can return any type of data (strings/JSON/binary...etc); we set mime_type to give client a hint of data we're returning\n",
    "- 2 types: Direct (static URI) and Templated (templated URI - parameters; matches param in resource function)\n",
    "- In our Project, we're implementing @Document_name feature - this will enable 1)the CLI auto-complete (i.e. showing a list of available documents) and 2)Claude additional context (via system prompt) to understand @ is referencing a document name directly.\n",
